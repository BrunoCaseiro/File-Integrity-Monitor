# File Integrity Monitor
## File Integrity Monitor in Python which continuously compares files to the initial baseline based on their MD5 hash, raising alerts if any deviations occur



This small little project is not meant to be very robust or aware of possible errors/exceptions. It works well under some predictable conditions, so it is prone to exceptions.

It is also not the most efficient code, but that's not the point. Scripting in cybersecurity means to write code fast and make it work asap, mostly for personal use
