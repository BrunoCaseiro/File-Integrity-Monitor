# File Integrity Monitor
###### Fun little project to keep my scripting skills sharp! I love scripting, but it's not something I get to do very often at work. These small programs keeps my coding bug entertained :)



This small little project is not meant to be very robust or aware of possible errors/exceptions. It works well under some predictable conditions, so it is prone to exceptions.

It is also not the most efficient code, but that's not the point. Scripting in cybersecurity means to write code fast and make it work asap, mostly for personal use
